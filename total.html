<p id="t1">If we go by the scientific definition, Trees are perennial plants with elongated trunks and stems. As we all know trees play a very important role in our survival. Trees are considered man's best friend. By doing photosynthesis they produce oxygen gas, which we humans inhale. The uses of trees are not just limited to the production of oxygen. Our existence on this planet is wholly dependent on plants and green vegetation. They also make our surroundings presentable, they provide fresh air which keeps our mind fresh by which we do any work more efficiently. Let's see in detail how trees and plants help us.</p>
<img id="t" src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQSQSKRqDB1p8YF5rPgd2UHTgWPT-t2gxdvZg&usqp=CAU" alt="" class="rounded" height="500px" width="600px"><br>
<p id="t1">These were some uses of trees and plants. Once Gandhi said There's enough for everyone's need but not for everyone's greed". But humans don't understand that. They have made the situation worse. So now to recover that, countries from different parts of the world have come together to save trees to preserve the planet earth. A few questions might come to your mind about what would happen if there are no trees. What's the need of saving trees? And what are the ways to save it? To make you realize the importance of trees let's answer them one by one.</p>
<img  id="t" src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTgIvUUjY8lJJ7uYjLQHYxt6lzxaPmvaY4eWg&usqp=CAU" alt="" class="img-thumbnail" height="500px" width="600px">
<p id="t1">Roots of trees and plants help in preventing soil erosion. So this helps in avoiding landslides and floods. Trees also play an important role in maintaining the water cycle. In recent times we have seen that groundwater level is decreasing. One of the ways to prevent that is by growing more trees.Humans have failed miserably at saving trees and the main reason behind it is deforestation. As the population is growing rapidly, humans require more land, and to do that we cut trees. Big companies are also cutting trees to spread their branches throughout the world.</p>
<br><br>

<h2 class="save" id="save tree">SAVE TREES</h2>
<p class="display-7 save1">Trees are considered the ‘lungs of our planet’, as they take in unwanted carbon dioxide and release purified oxygen for us to breathe through the process of photosynthesis, . Sadly, as a result of massive deforestation, the number of trees on the planet has declined drastically and has resulted in the reduction of fresh oxygen availability in the atmosphere. Deforestation is the major cause of air, water and soil pollution. Cutting down trees and clearing of forest lands often end up as ways to widen roads and construct buildings. It is necessary we take steps to put an end to this for a peaceful tomorrow. It’s high time we conducted awareness campaigns and take up social initiative to save tress and protect the environment.</p>
<p class="display-7 save2">The famous American author Munia Khan said, “Trees exhale for us so that we can inhale them to stay alive. Can we ever forget that? Let us love trees with every breath we take until we perish.” Let’s realise the actual worth of trees and join hands to save trees and protect our mother Trees play an integral role in our lives. We depend on trees for so many products and services, especially for the pure air released by them. Trees play a very vital role in maintaining the balance of our ecosystem. The trees sustain our entire planet’s biodiversity.</p>
<p class="display-7 save3">As we have seen in recent times humans are not able to protect trees which leads to many problems. One of the major problems is global warming. We see that glaciers are melting on a daily basis due to an increase in temperature. Due to the melting of glaciers sea level rises and leads to floods.
 Less number of trees means fewer roots to hold the rainwater, so we can say that deforestation is one of the reasons that cause floods. Deforestation loses the soil. Loose soil cannot act as a strong barrier so it cannot prevent floods.</p>
 <p class="save1">Trees are the only producers on Earth, while others are consumers. A tree provides us with oxygen, absorbs carbon dioxide, decorates the landscape with greenery, provides food, shelter, fuel and all other things necessary for survival. Data shows that 80% of terrestrial species live in forests. So it is our serious duty to protect and save trees, reduce deforestation and create awareness about nature conservation One of the best ways to create awareness is with Slogans. In this article we have listed 100+ Slogan to save trees. You can use them in brochures, posters, your writings and create awareness. Slogans on trees can have a direct impact on the human mind as they spread remarkable information in a catchy way.
</p>
<p  class="save2">Trees provide clean air, water, and food to us. Its greenery and freshness also act as a stress reliever for us. It gives a positive vibration in the atmoshphere. Trees also provide cool sheds during summers and during rains. Children also develop good memory when surrounded by green trees.Patients recover easily when comes in contact with greenery. There are a lot more things that tree provides us for ou better life.Trees produce fruits, medicine which are exported in many countries thus helping in economic growth. Cultivating trees and selling their product helps people earn their living. Trees provide wood and paper. It also acts as a natural cooler in summer thus reducing Ac bills and keeping the environment natural.</p>
<p class="save3">Trees have a lot of importance in our lives, and it provides seamless service for the environment. we have somehow not protected them and perhaps that is why as on today we are being affected by global warming, severe pollution and other ill effects of deforestation. Trees should be treated and nurtured nicely so that human beings can survive on this planet. We should encourage others to plant more and more trees. It is for our own betterment and the sooner we understand this the better it is for us.Trees intakes Carbon dioxide from air and breathe out fresh oxygen for our life support. This cycle is made by nature to sustain other living beings. Further, the Carbon dioxide breathed in by the trees is one of the greenhouse gases. This and other greenhouse gases, when released into the atmosphere form a layer and trap the heat from the sun. They result in an increase in the atmospheric temperature. This causes global warming. So planting more trees will clean the air will reduce the global warming effect.</p>
